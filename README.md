RIPTA transit service
===================


Golang service built to work with [RIPTA transit client](https://github.com/treiff/ripta-transit-client).
Fetches [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) data from Rhode Islands (RIPTA) real time [API](http://realtime.ripta.com:81/).


Usage
-------------

If your inclined to play around with this service, you'll just have to download the most up to date [**gtfs-realtime.proto**](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/gtfs-realtime.proto) file.

Some good documentation can be found at the link below to get going installing the necessary protobuf compiler. https://github.com/golang/protobuf
